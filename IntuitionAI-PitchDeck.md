# IntuitionAI Pitch Deck

## Project Overview
- **Project Name:** IntuitionAI
- **Tagline:** Personalized learning, intelligently adapted.
- **Elevator Pitch:** IntuitionAI is an adaptive learning platform that uses AI to personalize educational content based on individual learning patterns, skills, and preferences. By analyzing user interactions and performance, it provides custom learning paths that evolve with the learner.

## Inspiration
- **Principled Innovation:** Traditional education follows a one-size-fits-all approach, leaving many learners behind. IntuitionAI addresses this by creating an inclusive learning environment that adapts to each person's unique cognitive profile.
- **Motivation:** Our team experienced firsthand how different learning styles impact educational outcomes. We saw an opportunity to leverage AI to bridge these gaps and provide personalized education at scale.

## What it Does
- **Core Functionality:**
  - Personalized learning paths based on user skills and progress
  - AI-driven content recommendations
  - Adaptive assessments that evolve with learner proficiency
  - Real-time skill proficiency tracking
  - AI chatbot for learning assistance
  - User persona analysis for tailored learning experiences

- **Use Cases:**
  - A student struggling with data structures receives targeted resources matched to their visual learning style
  - A professional upskilling in computer science gets a custom curriculum based on their current skills and goals
  - An educator uses insights about student weaknesses to provide more effective support

## How We Built It
