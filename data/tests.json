          "correctAnswer": "Stack",
          "explanation": "A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle - the last element added is the first one to be removed."

          "correctAnswer": "O(log n)",
          "explanation": "In a balanced binary search tree, each comparison eliminates roughly half of the remaining tree, resulting in logarithmic time complexity."

          "correctAnswer": "To prevent overfitting",
          "explanation": "Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage the model from learning overly complex patterns that don't generalize well."
